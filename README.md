# Notes Web Application

My project is a Notes Web Application developed using vanilla JavaScript. It allows users to create, edit, archive, and delete notes. Each note consists of content, category, and creation date. Users can also mention dates within the content, which are extracted and displayed separately. The application provides a summary of active and archived notes categorized by their categories. The project uses modular architecture, with separate files for state management, rendering, and handling user interactions. The application provides a simple and intuitive interface for managing notes efficiently.
